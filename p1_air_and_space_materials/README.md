## Project 01 - Air and Space Materials

The Smithsonian's [National Air and Space Museum](https://airandspace.si.edu/) maintains the world's largest and most significant [collection](https://airandspace.si.edu/node/60201) of aviation and space artifacts, encompassing all aspects of human flight, as well as related works of art and archival materials. It operates two landmark facilities that, together, welcome more than eight million visitors a year, making it the most visited museum in the country. It also is home to the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies. 

In this project, I will foucus on the relations between different variables such us the aircraft's first service year, materials, origin of country, etc.
